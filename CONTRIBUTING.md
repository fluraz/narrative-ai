                     - - Follow existing code structure
                      
                       - - Keep font-weight ≤ 500
                        
                         - - Use bone background (#F8F8F6), not white
                          
                           - - Keep animations CSS-only (no Framer Motion)
                            
                             - - Maintain generous spacing

                               - - Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
                                
                                 - - Be descriptive but concise
                                  
                                   - - Reference issues if applicable: "Fix #123"
